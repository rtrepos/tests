Virtual Laboratory Environment 1.1.0
====================================

See AUTHORS and COPYRIGHT for the list of contributors.

VLE is an operational framework for multi-modeling, simulation and analysis of
complex dynamical systems. It addresses the reliability issue by using recent
developments in the theory of modeling and simulation proposed by B. Zeigler
with the Discrete Event System Specification formalism (DEVS).
