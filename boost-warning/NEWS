=============
VLE 1.1.0-dev
=============

Release highlights
==================

From VLE 1.1, the extension (FSA, Petri net, Difference Equation,
etc.) are provided into packages. A package can provides simulators,
data, documentation, headers and static libraries. A package can
depends of another package to be build and to be use at runtime of the
simulation.

The package can now be installed from remote repositories with the
command line interface or via GVLE. Packages and thiers build
dependencies and runtime dependencies are automatically downloaded and
builded.

To improve the stability of VLE, We merge all shared libraries of vle
(libvleutils, libvlevpz, libvledevs etc.) into an unique shared
library called ``libvle-1.1.so`` or ``vle-1.1.dll``. We provide a
archive called ``vle-1.1.a`` or ``vle-1.1.lib``. Under the Win32 port,

We remove the Eov program and the libvleeov shared library. Now,
graphical output are available into the GVLE application.

Add a dependency to the Boost::Asio library. Now, VLE depends on Asio
library to download data over http protocol.

Add a dependency to the libarchive library
(http://libarchive.github.com/) to extract gzip, bzip2 tarball and Zip
archives from the remote repositories.

Add an MPI mode with the command line interface MPI. For MPI, VLE
depends of an MPI library.

Switch VLE to Github.

Details
=======

VLE
---

We replace the init and finalize functions in old libvleutils,
libvlevalue, libvlemanager with a new classical object.

utils
-----

- Add a new RemoteMananger class to access remote repositories. The
  command line interface is inspirited from the apt-get debian's
  command:

  $ vle --remote update
  $ vle --remote install glue
  $ vle --remote search '*gl*'
  $ vle --remote show glue

- Change the packages directory name. To allow the use of VLE 1.0 and
  1.1 on the same ``$VLE_HOME`` directory, we need to clearly split the
  packages from the two versions. We add in the VLE's version.hpp file,
  a macro ``VLE_ABI_VERSION`` equal to
  ``VLE_VERSION_MAJOR.VLE_VERSION_MINOR``. We use this macro to define
  the name of the pkgs directory. For example, in VLE 1.1, the package
  directory is defined as ``vle/pkgs-1.1`` and in VLE 1.2, the package
  directory is defined as ``vle/pkgs-1.2``. The current stable version
  of VLE is not change and use packages in ``vle/pkgs`` directory.

- Remove Socket and Hosts classes. In VLE 1.1, we remove distant
  access to OOV and EOV. Thus, the utils::Socket and utils::Hosts are
  useless.

Manager
-------

Rewrite the Manager system:

- Add a new Manager class to improve the stability of the API. The
  manager class allows to run in thread and MPI mode the experimental
  frames.

- Add a Simulation class to replace JustRun and Run classes.

- Update the Types available in Manager. We prefer use the Matrix
  value instead of the OutputMatrix of the Oov namespace. Add operator
  and, or, xor, equal and different between SimulationOptions and
  LogOptions to ensure correct type casting.

vpz
---

- Remove any reference to distant and local dynamics plugins.

- Merge the libgraph.
